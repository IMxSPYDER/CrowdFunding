# **💡 Key Features**
- ✔️ Smart Contract-Based Fund Disbursement – Automates immediate aid transfers, preventing delays.
- ✔️ Real-Time Tracking – Immutable audit trails enhance transparency and donor confidence.
- ✔️ Automated Geolocation Verification – Ensures authenticity of beneficiaries through real-time GPS tracking.
- ✔️ Decentralized Identity (DID) & Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) – Prevents identity spoofing and duplicate donor registrations.
- ✔️ Multi-Factor Fraud Prevention – Verifies aid requests with real-time weather data, ensuring legitimacy.
